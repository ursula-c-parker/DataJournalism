    <h2 style="text-align: center">About our project</h2>
    <h5 style="text-align: left">We each came up with our own design for the macro and microviews, and then took the best elements of each model and combined them into a unified approach that is understandable, simple, and aesthetically pleasing. We chose to use materialize as our CSS platform.</h5>

    <li>Life expectancy refers to average age at which a person dies in the given region.</li>
    <li>Infant mortality refers to the rate at which infants do not survive past their first birthday.</li>
    <li>Data is presented as an average rate per 1000 people in a given region.</li>

    <img src="images/microviewUrsula.jpg" style="width:100%;">
    <figcaption>This was Ursula's possible version for the site's microview. We kept the idea of having charts that show the data over time, but we will add a slider that can change the dates. Also, we can make it cleaner by only having 1 chart where you can choose whether you are viewing life expectancy or main causes of death. We kept the idea of having checkboxes where you can see specific causes of death, and we figured that you should be able to check multiple at a time so you can compare data. From an understandability perspective, the page is good. It is clear what the graphs show. From a simplicity perspective, it might be better to integrate the two graphs into a single one and give more viewing options.</figcaption>

    <img src="images/macroviewUrsula.jpg" style="width:100%;">
    <figcaption>This was Ursula's possible version for the site's macroview. We liked the color-coding scheme and the idea that if you "zoomed in" on a country it would lead to a microview. The endless dropdown menus seemed like a hassle, so we decided to go with a slider instead to make the site cleaner.
      From the understandability design perspective, the page looks good. The captions are straight to the point and map makes sense. From the ease design perspective, the dropdown menu makes the design a little cluttered and hard to use.</figcaption>

    <img src="images/microviewMalachy.jpg" style="width:100%;">
    <figcaption>This was Malachy's possible version for the site's microview. We will keep the idea of using a slider to view different time intervals and including only 1 graph. We kept the idea of having checkboxes where you can see specific causes of death, and we figured that you should be able to check multiple at a time so you can compare data. From a simplicity perspective, the page is good. The graph is simple and easy to interpret. From a discoverability perspective, it would be better to include more captions to explain how to use the slider.</figcaption>

    <img src="images/macroviewMalachy.jpg" style="width:100%;">
    <figcaption>This was Malachy's possible version for the site's macroview. We liked the idea that if you click on a country it would lead to a microview. We also liked the generalized global data and will include that.
      From a discoverability perspective this page is good. Features have simple captions and data is presented clearly. From a structure perspective it may make sense to organize the data differently. </figcaption>
